## Lessons

* Significance of testing
  * Underestimated testing too much when it turned out actually to be one of the largest sections of code.
* Importance of team dynamics
  * Had a meeting at the start and end of each day.
  * Played games each morning to relax the mood.
  * Communicating effectively to avoid clashes.
* Time management
  * Allocated tasks to focus on for each day.
  * Should factor in the time needed for testing a bit more next time.
